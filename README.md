Setup:
Run npm install in both the server folder and frontend-client folders.
Then run node index.js in the server folder and then run npm start in the frontend-client folder.

The server should be running on port :5000 and the front end is on port :3000.

I did not have time to finish off the POST and PUT routes for User Story's 2 and 3, but I was able to implement the extra search capabilities of Users Four and Five.
